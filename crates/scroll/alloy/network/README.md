# scroll-alloy-network

Scroll blockchain RPC behavior abstraction.

This crate contains a simple abstraction of the RPC behavior of an
Scroll blockchain. It is intended to be used by the Alloy client to
provide a consistent interface to the rest of the library, regardless of
changes the underlying blockchain makes to the RPC interface.
